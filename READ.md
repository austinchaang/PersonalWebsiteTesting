# Personal Website Testing Project
This project was developed to test my [personal website](https://austinchang.ca). My Personal Website Testing Project integrates Selenium WebDriver with Java JUnit tests and Gradle as the build
tool, ensuring robust and automated testing processes. The project also applies the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to enhance test maintainability and reusability by segregating the test logic from my personal website's underlying web page structure.
